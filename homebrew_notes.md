If unsure whether to delete a package, see which other packages depend on it:
`brew uses <package_name>`

        rsync -av --delete /path/to/source/ /path/to/destination/
        echo "Backup completed successfully."
        ```
        
        `#!/bin/bash` is required to to tell the system to use the Bash shell to run the command
